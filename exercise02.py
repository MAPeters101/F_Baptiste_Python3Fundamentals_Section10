Question 2
Find all the numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive) that are divisible by any single
digit except 1.

For example, 22 is divisible by 2, so it should get included in the result.
But 11 is not divisible by any of the digits 2-9, so it should not get included.

Your solution should use comprehensions. (Hint: you may need nested loops in
your comprehension)

Next, find all the numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive) that are not in the list
of numbers you just generated.

If your code works correctly, you should end up with this result:

{1, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79,
83, 89, 97}
